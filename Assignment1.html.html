   <h3> Pune is a sprawling city in the western Indian state of Maharashtra. It was once the base of the Peshwas (prime ministers) of the Maratha Empire, which lasted from 1674 to 1818. It's known for the grand Aga Khan Palace, built in 1892 and now a memorial to Mahatma Gandhi, whose ashes are preserved in the garden. The 8th-century Pataleshwar Cave Temple is dedicated to the Hindu god Shiva. </h3>

      <table style="width:100%"><tr>
         <th><strong>RAJGAD </strong> <p>The fort has stood witness to many significant historic events including the birth of Shivaji's son Rajaram I, the death of Shivaji's wife Saibai, the return of Chatrapati Shivaji Maharaj from Agra, the burial of Afzal Khan's head in the Mahadarwaja walls of Balle Killa, the strict words of Sonopant Dabir to Shivaji.[citation needed]</p></th>
         <th><strong>SHANIWAR WADHA </strong><p>Shaniwar Wada is a historical fortification in the city of Pune, India.

            Built in 1732,[1] it was the great seat of the Peshwas of the Maratha Empire until 1818. Following the rise of the Maratha Empire, the palace became the center of Indian politics in the 18th century.[2]
            
            The fort itself was largely destroyed in 1828 by an unexplained fire, but the surviving structures are now maintained as a tourist site.</p></th>
         <th><strong>AGA KHAN PALACE</strong><p>The Aga Khan Palace was built by Sultan Muhammed Shah Aga Khan III in the city of Pune, India.

            The palace was an act of charity by the spiritual leader of the Nizari Ismaili Muslims, who wanted to help the poor in the neighbouring areas of Pune, who were drastically hit by famine.[1]
            
            The Aga Khan Palace is a majestic building.[2] The palace is closely linked to the Indian freedom movement as it served as a prison for Mahatma Gandhi, his wife Kasturba Gandhi.</p></th>
         <th><strong>PARVATI MANDIR</strong><p>The hill was owned by the Patil named Taware. Peshwa purchased the hill to build a temple of Shiva. The Devi temple was believed[by whom?] to be of Taware's kulswami whose angara was able to cure a leg ailment of Kashibai, mother of Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao.[3] Thereafter, the Peshwa built a temple complex there.</p></th>
